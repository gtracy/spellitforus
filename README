spellitforus is a app built originally for a Twilio dev contest. You can find a 
production release at http://spellitfor.us

The point of the app is to let kids practice their spelling in a new way and 
without any assistance from another person. When a test is taken, you are called
and prompted for each word. You answer by "typing" characters using the phone's 
keypad.

The goal of sharing this application is simply to make the code available for 
others to learn from. Not necessarily as a model for building a robust service.
After all, this was built in an afternoon. But there are some useful design
patterns specific to Twilio and managing call flow.

The app was originally deployed on App Engine and those support files are shared 
here. If you wish to run your own instance on App Engine, keep in the mind the 
following customizations you'll need to make...

1. app.yaml - Configure your own application id

2. testing.py - Configure your own Twilio and App Engine details...
 - Twilio account SID
 - Twilio account token
 - Twilio caller ID
 - App Engine domain stub

3. main.py - Configure your own Google Analytics ID

4. index.html, profile.html - Configure the footer details to link to your contact information.

I hope you find it useful, and if you can contribute improvements back, I will
be happy to deploy them!
